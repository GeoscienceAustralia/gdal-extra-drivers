GeoscienceAustralia/gdal-extra-drivers
======================================

This is a fork of gdal-extra-drivers that builds successfully against

- GDAL 3.7 from conda-forge
- GDAL 3.8 on Ubuntu 24.04

To make this happen, I:

- Removed the E00Grid, NTv1, and OpenAir drivers
- Tweaked FindGDAL.cmake
- Updated the signature of some override methods

It's in use on an ad-hoc basis in the NEAC to convert to/from BNA.

Original readme follows.

gdal-extra-drivers
==================

This repository contains legacy drivers for [GDAL/OGR](https://gdal.org), which
are built as a GDAL plugin.
They used to be included in the GDAL core library in versions prior to 3.3, but
they have been removed due to lack of interest to maintain them and because of
their marginal values for the majority of users.

They are known to work with GDAL 3.3. Compatibility with older or later versions
is not guaranteed.

This repository is *not* maintained. Users are on their own, unless someone
steps up to maintain it.
